			<h2>Employment</h2>
			<p class="sub">"Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life."<br><strong>Confucius</strong></p>
			<h3>Onstate Ltd | Junior Web Developer<br><span style="font-size: 0.75em;">(May 2018 - Oct 2018)</span></h3>
			<p>
				My first full time job after finishing my degree at university involved working as a junior web developer at 
				Onstate Ltd in Leeds. My role there was mainly to work on support tickets for a range of clients, which involved 
				fixing bugs, adding new features and general support tasks. Most of the time this was back-end PHP work or site 
				configuration, but occasionally some minor front-end development was also required.
			</p>
			<p>
				During my time at Onstate, I had the opportunity to extend my knowledge of various technologies in addition to 
				learning about new ones. I gained experience of working with version control, including feature branching when 
				multiple pieces of work were ongoing within the team. I also got to do development work locally using virtual 
				machines as previously I only had experience developing using web server packages such as XAMPP. The main 
				learning curve, however, was getting to grips with Magento, which is the main e-commerce platform/framework they 
				use for most of their sites. My experiences with Magento involved installing/updating/configuring modules, 
				creating/editing products via the Magento admin panel, setting up CMS pages and overriding third-party modules 
				and templates to customise their functionality to suit the requirements of the client.
			</p>
			<p>
				Working on tickets also helped my written communication skills by allowing me to respond to clients about 
				raised queries, whether this was informing them a task has been completed, asking for further details about 
				the inquiry or offering general support.
			</p>
			<h3>University of Huddersfield | Technical Assistant<br><span style="font-size: 0.75em;">(Sept 2015 - Aug 2016)</span></h3>
			<p>
				My placement year was spent working in the Learning Technology Support Unit in the School of Human and 
				Health Sciences. My primary role involved working in a development team of two people, programming the back-end 
				for database-driven PHP web applications. This also included creating the databases used by these applications 
				and writing the queries to retrieve and modify the data.
			</p>
			<p>
				The main project I worked on was the Peer Review of Research Applications Management System (PRRAMS). PRRAMS 
				is a web application developed by myself and one other placement colleague, which allows research staff in the School of 
				Human and Health Sciences at the University of Huddersfield to apply for funding for research projects. Users 
				can upload proposals which can be approved or referred to management by a reviewer. Reviewers also must provide 
				feedback afterwards. My role in the development of the site was to program the back-end in PHP and to build the 
				MySQL database and write queries for retrieving/updating the data.
			</p>
			<p>
				Other projects worked on include a podiatry clinic simulation game created in the Unity engine and an anagram 
				quiz game in Flash.
			</p>
			<p>
				Aside from web development, my secondary role was to respond to support queries from staff and students having 
				problems using the Unilearn VLE.

			<h2>Projects</h2>
			<p class="sub">"I think it's good."<br><strong>Ben Haigh</strong></p>
			<p>
				Below are some of the personal projects I have worked on both during and after university, including my final year project, the custom PHP
				framework it was build with and educational projects I've made to help me learn new technologies and skills.
			</p>
			<h3 class="project-title">CinderPHP | PHP MVC Framework<br><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">PHP</span></h3>
			<img src="img/cinderphp.png"></img>
			<p>
				CinderPHP is a basic MVC framework I created during my time working at the University of Hudderfield. The intention was to create a solution that would help 
				to make one of our main projects much easier to develop by reducing duplicated code, having a separation of concerns in terms of logic and having URL routing 
				and templating systems, which would all contribute towards making the project much more easily maintainable for both us and any future placement students.
			</p>
			<h4>Routing</h4>
			<p>
				When an incoming request occurs from a client browser, the requested URL is processed by the router to determine which controller should be instantiated 
				and which action should be called. It will also check for any additional parameters, which would be passed as parameters when calling the controller function 
				for the specified action. For example, if the requested URL was <i>'[root]/users/detail/1'</i>, it would instantiate <code>UsersController</code> and call the 
				<code>detail()</code> action, passing the '1' as the parameter.
			</p>
			<h4>Controllers</h4>
			<p>
				The controllers work by having a separate function for each available action/page related to it. Within these functions, you can specify functionality 
				such as requesting data from the model, retrieving form data via POST request and passing data to the template to be displayed by the view.
			</p>
			<p>
				It will also automatically create and store an instance of a model object, which is named using the same prefix as the controller (if such a class exists 
				within the 'models' folder). This means that the model can always be accessed by using <code>$this->model</code> without having to manually include 
				and create an instance of it. If you require access to other models besides this, the <code>loadModel()</code> function can fetch these for you.
				Models for controllers are also optional, so if you do not want your controller to have an associated model (e.g. a controller for displaying static pages), 
				this can be avoided by simply overriding the super constructor of the parent controller class.
			</p>
			<h4>Data Access</h4>
			<p>
				In order to access data stored within a MySQL database, each controller can have an assigned model object as specified above. These model classes can 
				contain functions which specify how to retrieve/send data to/from the database and how to process the result before it is returned to the controller. 
				Generally, the controller would then pass the resulting data to either some other component function or to the template so that it can be displayed to the user 
				via the view.
			</p>
			<p>
				The framework includes a <code>Database</code> class, which all model object types have access to. This class contains various generic functions needed for 
				database CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations. For more complex or obscure queries, there is a <code>runQuery()</code> function to allow you to manually 
				modify the query being run, which is useful if you need something more than a basic CRUD operation. This class uses PHP's built-in PDO interface to connect to and 
				query the database.
			</p>
			<h4>Templating and Views</h4>
			<p>
				The template object is in charge of searching for and rendering the correct template based on which controller action has been invoked and also storing all 
				of the variables passed from the controller, which will be used within the view to display to the user.
			</p>
			<p>
				The template's <code>render()</code> function will search for the required view file along with either the site's default header and footer or specific 
				ones for the given page if they exist and 'include' them. It will also extract the elements stored in the associative array of variables to be used within 
				view so that they can be accessed like regular variables in the view file. This function is invoked upon destruction of the controller object, ensuring it 
				is the last action that occurs before the page is displayed.
			</p>
			<p>
				The views themselves are simply PHP files containing the HTML code for the front-end elements of the site with PHP code embedded where necessary for displaying 
				any dynamic content.

			<h3 class="project-title">Athena | Final Year Project<br><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS</span></h3>
			<a href="https://selene.hud.ac.uk/u1354494/athena" target="_blank"><img src="img/athena.jpg"></img></a>
			<p>My final year project involved developing a PHP application to facilitate task management and communication within teams. Users can create/join/manage teams, create/manage tasks and communicate via 
			discussion threads.</p>
			<p>An additional feature allows users to customise the website's colour scheme. The colour can be set to any RGB colour or one can be selected from a list of presets. This also affects the Gantt chart as
			tasks assigned to a specific user will appear in their chosen colour.</p>
			<p>The back-end was developed in PHP using a simplistic MVC framework I had created previously and all HTML and CSS for the responsive front-end was written from scratch without frameworks.</p>
